    "# `runSofa` and Scene Configuration\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to use the `runSofa` executable to launch SOFA simulations and how to write Python scripts that are compatible with both the SOFA graphical user interface and standalone Python execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the role of the `runSofa` executable.\n",
    "- Learn the `createScene` entry point for SOFA scripts.\n",
    "- Write hybrid scripts compatible with both `runSofa` and the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- Configure scenes for different execution environments.\n",

    "## 1. What is `runSofa`?\n",
    "`runSofa` is the primary executable shipped with SOFA. It is a C++ application that provides a full-featured graphical environment for loading, visualizing, and interacting with SOFA scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can run SOFA entirely from a Python script (as seen in previous tutorials), using `runSofa` offers several advantages:\n",
    "- Built-in scene inspection tools.\n",
    "- Real-time parameter modification.\n",
    "- Optimized rendering and recording tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "First, let's import the `Sofa` module."

    "To make a Python script compatible with `runSofa`, you must define a special entry point: the `createScene` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `runSofa` loads a Python file, it:\n",
    "1. Imports the module.\n",
    "2. Looks for a function named `createScene`.\n",

    "### The `SofaPython3` Plugin\n",

    "## 4. Writing Hybrid Scripts\n",
    "A common best practice is to write scripts that can be executed both by `runSofa` (for GUI interaction) and by the Python interpreter (for automated testing or headless processing).\n",

    "To achieve this, we use the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom.\n",
